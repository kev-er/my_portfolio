          Hi! I'm a self-taught Frontend Developer. The past few years I have
          been working for a medical company as a learning specialist on their
          product support help line. My job has been to train, support and up
          skill the staff over four different lines of business. This experience
          has given me incredible opportunities to collaborate with diverse
          teams and shoulder substantial responsibilities which I am exited to
          bring with wherever I go next.{" "}
